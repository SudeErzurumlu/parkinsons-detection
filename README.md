# Parkinson's Disease Detection

This repository contains code for detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. The project implements a Random Forest Classifier to predict the status of patients based on various features derived from voice recordings.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is obtained from Kaggle. It contains features extracted from voice recordings of patients with Parkinson's disease. You can access the dataset [here]((https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyadutta1116/parkinsons-disease/)).

### Dataset Features
- `name`: Identifier for each record (not used in training)
- `status`: Target variable (1 indicates Parkinson's disease, 0 indicates no Parkinson's disease)
- Various features representing vocal attributes

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudeErzurumlu/parkinsons-detection.git
